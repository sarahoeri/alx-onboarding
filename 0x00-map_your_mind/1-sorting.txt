Pseudo code theat reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order:

one = INPUT first number('First numer is: ')
two = INPUT second number('Second number is: ')
three = INPUT third number('Third number is: ')

IF (one < two) $$ (one < three) :
    PRINT("one")
  ELSE IF (two > three):
      PRINT("three")
  ELSE IF (one > two):
      PRINT("two")
  ELSE:
      PRINT("one","two","three")
